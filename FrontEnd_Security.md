# Front End Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our front-end application, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.


We request that you not publicly disclose the issue until we have had a chance to address it.

## Security Measures

Our front end employs several security measures to ensure data integrity and protection against threats:

- **Input Validation**: To prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and injection attacks, all user inputs are validated and sanitized.
- **Secure Communication**: All data transferred between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS.
- **Content Security Policy**: We implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the risk of content injection attacks.
- **Regular Audits**: We conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

## Contribution

If you're a developer and wish to contribute to improving our front-end security, please submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes and their benefits.

Thank you for helping keep our application secure!

# IE Bank Frontend Security Policy

## Overview
This document outlines the security protocols and guidelines governing the IE Bank Frontend project. Our objective is to establish a comprehensive framework for handling security vulnerabilities, providing clear directives for both contributors and users. This ensures the project's integrity and safety. Committed to robust security practices, we have integrated advanced tools such as GitHub's Advanced Security features like CodeQL for semantic code analysis and Dependabot for managing dependencies.

If you discover a potential security vulnerability, we urge you to report it promptly. Our dedicated team is committed to addressing security concerns urgently and discreetly, aiming to acknowledge and respond to reports within a 72-hour timeframe. Refer to the subsequent sections for reporting guidelines.

## Security Guidelines and Procedures
To bolster our project's security, we adhere to best practices and standards, including:

- **Branch Protection Rules:** Enforcing strict rules on branch modifications to prevent unauthorized changes and maintain code integrity.
- **CodeQL**
- **CODEOWNERS File:** Utilizing GitHub's CODEOWNERS feature to automatically assign reviewers and manage code review processes effectively.
- **OSSF Scorecard:** Employing Open Source Security Foundation (OSSF) Scorecards to assess and improve our repository's security posture.
- **SAFECODE:** Following principles and practices outlined by the Software Assurance Forum for Excellence in Code (SAFECODE) to ensure secure and reliable code development.
- **OPENSSF:** Adhering to principles and practices outlined by the Open Security Source Foundation to ensure secure and reliable code development.

## Security Configurations
We encourage users and team members to adhere to specific security-related configurations to enhance the overall project security. Detailed instructions and guidelines for secure configurations are available to team members and contributors upon request. These guidelines align with our overarching security protocols and best practices.

## Identified Security Gaps & Future Improvements
Recognizing the dynamic nature of software security, we actively:

- Continuously monitor and assess code for vulnerabilities.
- Implement timely updates and patches to address known issues.
- Focus on future enhancements to strengthen our security infrastructure and expand vulnerability detection capabilities.

## Recognition
We extend our sincere gratitude to our dedicated team members, whose relentless efforts and contributions significantly bolster the security of the IE Bank Frontend project. Their expertise and commitment play a pivotal role in maintaining high-security standards.
