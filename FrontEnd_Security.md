# Front End Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our front-end application, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

Please submit your report via email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com), including the following information:

- Description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the issue or proof of concept.
- Any relevant screenshots or logs.

We request that you not publicly disclose the issue until we have had a chance to address it.

## Security Measures

Our front end employs several security measures to ensure data integrity and protection against threats:

- **Input Validation**: To prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and injection attacks, all user inputs are validated and sanitized.
- **Secure Communication**: All data transferred between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS.
- **Content Security Policy**: We implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the risk of content injection attacks.
- **Regular Audits**: We conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

## Contribution

If you're a developer and wish to contribute to improving our front-end security, please submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes and their benefits.

Thank you for helping keep our application secure!
